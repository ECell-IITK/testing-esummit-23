                    Pitching your idea to a group of investors is incredibly nerve-wracking. Always puts you in a
                    dilemma
                    whether investors like your idea or not.
                    Most of all, you wonder if they're going to fund you or not. Even if one has money in the bank,
                    there
                    sure is going to be a point where one simply has to get additional funding to grow their startup, to
                    start scaling up. To achieve this you need to understand the perspective of the person sitting on
                    the
                    other side of the table.
                    So we bring to you a competition that will actually put you in the shoes of investors thereby
                    teaching
                    you a lot about what investors want and how to position the companies for successful pitches in the
                    future.
                    Students participating here are the investors, not the entrepreneurs. They do not have to come up
                    with
                    startup ideas. Rather, they would play the role of Angel Investors/Analysts in a VC firm assessing
                    the
                    startups being posed to them as potential investments.

            <p>Participants would play the role of Angel who has $5Mn to invest in one or more of the startups presenting. They’ll be assessing the investment opportunities and pitching an investment strategy to the VC judges.
                Participants would be provided with detailed information about 8 startups including their target user persona, market segment, target sectors, profitability, CAGR of market size and other related terms, etc.  
                It would be their job to gauge the startups and make a calculated decision as to what startup they should invest in and in return for what equity. 
                They would be presenting this reasoning in front of a panel of judges(the actual VCs) who would be assessing and questioning their presentation. 
                Investment should be made in such a way that new valuation should be between asked valuation and the last round valuation.
                Team Size - 1-5 members
                The presentation should comprise of:8 pitch decks will be provided for companies Edtech(.), Fintech(1), Web3, Crypto(0), Blockchain(.), Pharma(1), Biotech(0) and Product(1).
                The conduction of the Competition will be done in the following manner:
                Round 1: Qualification
                Form will be floated wherein you will be given the 8 pitch decks as mentioned above and you will be required to fill the team details and how much will you be investing in the companies of your choice
                Round 2: Judges’ Round (5+7)
                A form will be released for collecting the Portfolio PPT which should contain the information as mentioned above.
                Total duration of Round 2 will be 12 minutes per team which will be distributed in 5 minutes of Pitching and 7 minutes of QnA.
                Final results will be solely based on Round 2.

            <p>There is no quantitative way to determine a best team just as there is no specific formula to determine the “Best VC” (except financial returns, and we won’t have the time to wait for the returns).
                There are many successful VCs with wildly varying philosophies and approaches, and your judging panel will likely reflect some of those differences. In other words, different judges may be looking for different things even though they have the same “criteria” in front of them.
                Judges also care a lot about how you demonstrate value as a firm, as this is an important part of the business (especially in boom times).
                Shortlisting for Round 2: Will be done on basis of company profile
                Judging for Round 2: Judging will be done based on QnA, Quality of Diversity of Portfolio, Technical Knowledge, Presentation Skills, Reasoning and Communication Skills.
