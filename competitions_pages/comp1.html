                    Pitching your idea to a group of investors is incredibly nerve-wracking. Always puts you in a
                    dilemma
                    whether investors like your idea or not.
                    Most of all, you wonder if they're going to fund you or not. Even if one has money in the bank,
                    there
                    sure is going to be a point where one simply has to get additional funding to grow their startup, to
                    start scaling up. To achieve this you need to understand the perspective of the person sitting on
                    the
                    other side of the table.
                    So we bring to you a competition that will actually put you in the shoes of investors thereby
                    teaching
                    you a lot about what investors want and how to position the companies for successful pitches in the
                    future.
                    Students participating here are the investors, not the entrepreneurs. They do not have to come up
                    with
                    startup ideas. Rather, they would play the role of Angel Investors/Analysts in a VC firm assessing
                    the
                    startups being posed to them as potential investments.
